#blueprint_coffee_timer_angular_tastypie
A simple timer for brewing the perfect cup of coffee.

Using [Django-Tastypie](https://django-tastypie.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), some of [MeanJS](http://meanjs.org/) and [angular-resource-tastypie](https://github.com/mw-ferretti/angular-resource-tastypie)

From terminal:

1. npm install (Might have to sudo and then run again without cuz bower!)

2. run grunt

3. You can test the front end  by running the following command in terminal:

./simple_server

Then navigate to: [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

Use 'Control + c' to shut down simple_server
